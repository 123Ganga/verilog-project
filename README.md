Introduction to AES
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of the most widely used cryptographic algorithms for securing digital data. It was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001 to replace the older Data Encryption Standard (DES), which became insecure due to its small 56-bit key size. AES is a symmetric key block cipher, meaning the same secret key is used for both encryption and decryption. It operates on fixed data blocks of 128 bits and 
supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, making it highly secure and efficient for modern applications such as internet communication, banking systems, cloud storage, and embedded systems.
Need for FPGA Implementation of AES
Although AES can be implemented in software, software-based encryption suffers from limitations such as slower execution speed, dependency on processor performance, operating system overhead, and higher vulnerability to certain attacks. To overcome these issues, hardware-based implementation using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) is preferred. FPGA implementation allows parallel processing, low latency, and high throughput, making it suitable for real-time and high-speed encryption applications. Additionally, FPGAs provide flexibility, reconfigurability, 
and better control over hardware resources compared to application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).
Working Principle of AES Algorithm
AES follows a substitution–permutation network structure. It processes the input plaintext of 128 bits by arranging it into a 4×4 byte matrix called the state array. The encryption process begins with an initial AddRoundKey operation, followed by multiple rounds of transformations. The number of rounds depends on the key size: 10 rounds for AES-128, 12 rounds for AES-192, and 14 rounds for AES-256. Each round increases data confusion and diffusion, ensuring strong
resistance against cryptographic attacks.
AES Round Transformations
Each AES round (except the final round) consists of four main transformations: SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey. SubBytes uses an S-Box to substitute each byte in the state array, providing non-linearity and security. ShiftRows cyclically shifts the rows of the state array to improve diffusion. MixColumns performs matrix multiplication in a finite field to mix data within each column, strengthening resistance against attacks. Finally, AddRoundKey combines the state with a round key using XOR operation. The last round excludes the MixColumns
step to maintain correct decryption.
Key Expansion and AES Variants
AES uses a key scheduling algorithm to generate multiple round keys from the original secret key. Although the original key may be 128, 192, or 256 bits long, each round key is always 128 bits. These round keys are applied sequentially in each encryption round. Based on key size, AES is classified into AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256, with increasing number of rounds and higher security levels. AES-128 is commonly used due to its balance between security and
performance, especially in FPGA implementations.
Literature Survey and Prior Work
Several research works have focused on FPGA-based AES implementations to improve speed, area efficiency, and security. Studies comparing software and hardware implementations show that FPGA-based AES achieves significantly higher throughput and lower latency. Other works propose optimized VHDL or Verilog designs using iterative or pipelined architectures to reduce hardware usage. Advanced approaches such as dual-key AES and key-based S-Box generation have been introduced to enhance security and reduce vulnerability to cryptanalysis, 
while maintaining acceptable performance.
Implementation and Results
In this project, AES-128 encryption was implemented on a Spartan-6 FPGA using Verilog HDL. The design was simulated and verified using tools such as ModelSim and Chipscope (Integrated Logic Analyzer). The encryption outputs matched the expected ciphertext values, confirming functional correctness. The design operated reliably at around 100 MHz clock frequency and showed efficient utilization of FPGA resources such as LUTs, registers, and Block RAM. Real-time monitoring through Chipscope enabled easy debugging and 
validation of internal AES stages.
Conclusion and Future Scope
The FPGA implementation of the AES algorithm demonstrates that hardware-based encryption provides high performance, strong security, and suitability for real-time applications. The successful realization of AES-128 confirms the effectiveness of FPGA platforms for cryptographic systems in embedded, IoT, and secure communication domains. Future enhancements can include extending the design to AES-192 and AES-256, optimizing power consumption, improving resistance to side-channel attacks, and integrating dynamic key management techniques. This makes FPGA-based AES a scalable and
robust solution for modern data security needs.
