1))Implementation of AES algorithm
An AES is the most popular security algorithm and AES encrypts sensitive data stored in databases,protecting
it from unauthorized access even if the database is compramised.
2)) Emotion recognition based on facial expressions
This project focuses on Emotion detection using facial expression is implemented using Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN),has demonstrated good performance.
3))Radiology report generation using CT Scan images
Radiology report generation from CT scans uses deep learning to detect and analyze abnormalities in 3D
medical images. Extracted features are fed into vision-language models to generate descriptive reports.
